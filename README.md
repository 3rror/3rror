### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gianluca Andreotti. ðŸ˜„

I am an Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ student of **Computer Science**, with a passion for (almost) everything computer-related.

Even if my time is currently mainly spent on studying, I am a **versatile developer** with many horizontal skills.

In my life, I would like to create **high-quality software** that simplifies people's lives every day.
