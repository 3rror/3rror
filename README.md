### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Gianluca Andreotti. ğŸ˜„

I am an Italian ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ student of Computer Science, with a passion for (almost) everything computer-related.

Even if my time is currently mainly spent on studying, I am a versatile developer with many horizontal skills.

In my life, I would like to create very high-quality software that simplifies people's lives every day.
